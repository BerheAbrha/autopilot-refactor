# 🚀 AutoPilot for Legacy Code Refactoring

## 🧠 #AIForHardThings Hackathon Project

AutoPilot is an AI-powered agent designed to tackle one of the hardest challenges in software engineering: refactoring legacy code safely, intelligently, and at scale.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Legacy codebases are critical but notoriously difficult to maintain. They often:
- Lack documentation
- Use outdated dependencies
- Exhibit tight coupling and architectural anti-patterns

Manual refactoring is slow, risky, and requires deep domain expertise. AutoPilot aims to automate and de-risk this process using AI.

## 💡 Solution Overview

AutoPilot:
- **Analyzes** legacy code for technical debt and anti-patterns
- **Suggests** refactors using LLMs trained on modern design principles
- **Simulates** impact using dependency graphs and test coverage analysis
- **Auto-generates** unit tests to validate refactored components
